# Legal Document Management System

## Executive Summary

The Legal Document Management System aims to provide a structured approach for managing legal documents efficiently. By leveraging MongoDB's flexibility, scalability, and document-oriented nature, this system aims to streamline document storage, retrieval, and management processes for legal professionals.

## Project Requirements

- Store various types of legal documents securely.
- Facilitate efficient search and retrieval of documents based on different criteria.
- Allow for version control and tracking changes in documents.
- Enable user authentication and access control mechanisms.
- Support metadata management for documents.

## Data Model (5 Collections)

### 1. Users

{
  "_id": "user_id",
  "username": "username",
  "password": "hashed_password",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "user_role",
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "updated_at": "timestamp"
}
### 2. Documents

{
  "_id": "document_id",
  "title": "document_title",
  "content": "document_content",
  "type": "document_type",
  "created_by": "user_id",
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "updated_at": "timestamp",
  "versions": [
    {
      "version_number": 1,
      "content": "version_content",
      "created_by": "user_id",
      "created_at": "timestamp"
    }
  ]
}
### 3. Tags

{
  "_id": "tag_id",
  "name": "tag_name",
  "documents": ["document_id1", "document_id2"],
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "updated_at": "timestamp"
}
### 4. Categories

{
  "_id": "category_id",
  "name": "category_name",
  "documents": ["document_id1", "document_id2"],
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "updated_at": "timestamp"
}
### 5. Comments

{
  "_id": "comment_id",
  "document_id": "document_id",
  "user_id": "user_id",
  "content": "comment_content",
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "updated_at": "timestamp"
}
Conclusion
In conclusion, the proposed MongoDB document structure provides a solid foundation for developing a robust Legal Document Management System. By organizing data into collections such as Users, Documents, Tags, Categories, and Comments, the system can effectively manage legal documents, support version control, enable efficient search and retrieval, and ensure secure access control. This design allows for scalability and flexibility to adapt to the evolving needs of legal professionals.
